          | Irrespective of the download size, the entire process can be very resource intensive. 
          | In order to fufill a download request, we start by transfering the files from our secure data store onto your machine. 
          | At the same time as this happens, Binder begins decrypting each file locally. 
          | Once this is completed, you will be notified that your files are ready.
